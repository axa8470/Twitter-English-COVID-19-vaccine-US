This dataset is analyzed in the article "Your Tweets Matter: How Social Media Sentiments Associate with COVID-19 Vaccination Rates in the US".

Note that this dataset is a portion of the CoVaxxy: A collection of English-language Twitter posts about COVID-19 vaccines (https://github.com/osome-iu/CoVaxxy). The portion extracted is from January 4 -  May 11, 2021,  when  the  COVID-19  vaccine  was  approved and  vaccination  started. However, the dataset was additionally cleaned (check the details in the full paper: https://ojphi.org/ojs/index.php/ojphi/article/view/12419).

Tweets in this repository were posted within the United States, where the state of tweet origin was found for each tweet. The dataset includes a total of 243,202 tweets belonging to 95,292 unique users. Therefore, we provide tweet ids of the clean dataset and their corresponding state of origin, so other researchers can replicate our work.
